<p>My journey through life lead me to leaving my small comforting hometown to coming to a University with around 12,000 students being in enrolled. </p>
<p> I applied to eight schools and being accepted into seven of them. After a lot of time and though I narrowed down my decision to two schools Keene State College and the University of Maine at Orono. </p>
<p> My parents had both gone to Keene and when I went to visit the school in the summer leading up into my senior year of high school but when narrowing my decision I decided to end up attended the University of Maine due to me being able to receive in-state tuition.</p>
<p> Upon my arrival to the University I was very nervous and shy about weather or not I would make any friends, do well in class, e.t.c... To get myself out there I decided to rush Kappa Sigma. </P>

<p> Becoming a Kappa Sigma here at the University of Maine has not only made college an easier and more fun place to be, but has molded me into the young man I am today.I have got to know so many more people and made so many more connections than I would have had if I had not been choosen to be a part of kappa Sigma. I am also able to help the community and give back to my peers and those in need by participating in philanthropy events put on by my fraternity.</p>
