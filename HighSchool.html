<p><center> I was born on June 4, 1998 In Dover, New Hampshire. </p>
<p> I was the first and only child of my two parents.</p>
<p> My parents deciding to buy a house in the town of North Berwick which is about 25 minutes from Dover, NH. 
<p> Some of my first memories as a child is running around my front yard which is around the size of a football field and catching frogs in my pond with all my cousins.</p>
<p> As I started to grow older I started to fall in love with sports, though I tried numerous sports, three really stuck to me. Those are Football, Wrestling, and Baseball.</p>

<p> During my senior year of high school time started to fly by with me being so busy with sports. I was offered two offers to play football at the collegiate level, one being at Plymouth State University and the other being at Maine Maritime Academy. </P>
<p>Though in the long run my journey through life did not lead me down either of those paths but the to the University of Maine.</P></Center>
