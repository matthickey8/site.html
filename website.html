<p>This assignment is one of tose assignment that you get not so often that actually comes off as useful knowledge for the future.</P>
<p> Before taking this class I had zero experience with working with coding. I thought it would be much harder than it actually was. But this is useful for me in my job future in case I ever need to design a website for a company I work for or even my own.
