<p> As I am still only a sophomore graduation seems so far away but I know that the next thing I'll know I'll be taking a picture with a diploma in my hand. For me it's hard to accurately talk about what the future will be like because so much can happen in the time to come. Right now at this moment in time I am working towards a degree in Business Management; as of now there is nothing I could see altering my major. My Dad worked for UPS for 32 years until his retirement last May. He helped me secure a job at the local UPS in Brewer which is about a twenty minute drive from my house. I started off with a seasonal postion this summer guarantying me that I would have work until September 15th. With hard work I was able to secure a spot with a permeant postion which provides me with tuition, paid vacations, and also health insurance; I feel proud that I already have these benefits at the age of only 19. The job works perfect with my academic and social life because I only work from 5:00 P.M - 9:30 P.M.</P>
<p> The point I'm trying to get to is that as of now UPS is a career path I can honestly see myself going down. Moving my way into becoming a package car driver and then with my Business Management degree I can work my way up to being a supervisor where I would be able to use my knowledge gained through my Business Management degree to succesful run a UPS center. When trying to explain to friends and peers about my plan they seem to not take me seriously or are ignorant on the pay and benefits of the job.
